# Burn and Close Solana SPL Tokens SDK

A lightweight Solana SDK to **burn SPL tokens and close token accounts** with the June 2026 Unclaimed SOL token cleanup fee policy.
This library only **builds unsigned transactions** – you handle signing and sending them, whether in the browser (Wallet Adapter) or server (Keypair).

## ✨ Features

- 🔥 Burn all tokens in provided ATAs.
- 🧹 Close token accounts, reclaiming rent to the user.
- 💸 On-chain fee recipient is enforced by the program.
- 🧾 Standard token cleanup lets the user keep up to 0.002 SOL per closed account; normal-account fee is 39,280 lamports.
- ⚡ Automatic batching (default 12 ATAs per transaction).
- 🪙 Supports SPL Token and Token-2022.
- 🔐 Supports **frontend partial signing** and **backend full signing** workflows.
- 🚀 No hidden config: single function to integrate.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The SDK prepares TransactionInstructions for your on-chain burn+close program.
2. Program burns tokens in each ATA, then closes it, sending rent back to the owner.
3. The program sends recovered rent above 2,000,000 lamports per successfully closed account to the hardcoded fee recipient.
4. The SDK never asks for private keys — you sign & send transactions yourself.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm i @unclaimedsol/spl-burn-close-sdk
```

We use @solana/web3.js in peerDependencies to avoid version conflicts, so make sure you already have it installed.

Requires Node 18+.

## 🔑 Usage

### Signing with Keypair

```typescript
import { Connection, Keypair, PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";
import {
  buildBurnAndCloseTransactions,
  PROGRAM_ID,
} from "@unclaimedsol/spl-burn-close-sdk";

const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");
const keypair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(/* Uint8Array */);
const user = keypair.publicKey;

// You can get easily obtain pairs using getTokenAccountsByOwner method
const pairs = [{ mint: new PublicKey("MINT_1"), ata: new PublicKey("ATA_1") }];

const txs = await buildBurnAndCloseTransactions(
  connection,
  PROGRAM_ID,
  user,
  pairs
);

for (const tx of txs) {
  tx.partialSign(keypair);
  const sig = await connection.sendRawTransaction(tx.serialize());
  let latestBlockhash = await connection.getLatestBlockhash(
    connection.commitment
  );
  await connection.confirmTransaction({
    signature: sig,
    blockhash: latestBlockhash.blockhash,
    lastValidBlockHeight: latestBlockhash.lastValidBlockHeight,
  });
  console.log("✅ Sent:", sig);
}
```

### Signing with Wallet Adapter

```typescript
import { Connection, PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";
import {
  buildBurnAndCloseTransactions,
  PROGRAM_ID,
  TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
} from "@unclaimedsol/spl-burn-close-sdk";

const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");
const user = wallet.publicKey; // Wallet Adapter

// You can get easily obtain pairs using getTokenAccountsByOwner method
const pairs = [
  { mint: new PublicKey("MINT_1"), ata: new PublicKey("ATA_1") },
  { mint: new PublicKey("MINT_2"), ata: new PublicKey("ATA_2") },
];

const txs = await buildBurnAndCloseTransactions(
  connection,
  PROGRAM_ID,
  user,
  pairs
);

// For Token-2022 accounts, pass TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID and consider using a smaller chunkSize:
// const txs = await buildBurnAndCloseTransactions(
//   connection,
//   PROGRAM_ID,
//   user,
//   pairs,
//   { chunkSize: 2 },
//   TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID
// );

// Sign
const signed = wallet.signAllTransactions
  ? await wallet.signAllTransactions(txs)
  : await Promise.all(txs.map((t) => wallet.signTransaction!(t)));

// Send
for (const stx of signed) {
  const sig = await connection.sendRawTransaction(stx.serialize());
  let latestBlockhash = await connection.getLatestBlockhash(
    connection.commitment
  );
  await connection.confirmTransaction({
    signature: sig,
    blockhash: latestBlockhash.blockhash,
    lastValidBlockHeight: latestBlockhash.lastValidBlockHeight,
  });
  console.log("✅ Sent:", sig);
}
```

## 🌐 Cluster support

This SDK targets the Unclaimed SOL mainnet program (`PROGRAM_ID`) and fee recipient (`FEE_RECIPIENT`).
Transactions will only succeed on a cluster where that program is deployed.

---

## 💻 Demo

There is a nice tutorial guide with a demo repository that shows the usage of the SDK to burn and close all token accounts for the wallet. You can find it [here](https://blog.unclaimedsol.com/close-burn-solana-tokens-web3js-sdk/).

## 📜 Disclaimer

This SDK only **builds transactions** to burn tokens and close accounts. You are solely responsible for signing and sending them. We are not liable for any loss of funds.
